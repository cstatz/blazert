Roadmap
=======

Consider this roadmap a rather **loose plan** for future releases. New features will be implemented mainly based on our needs
as of now; however, you can always open an issue on github with feature requests or open a pull request if you have implemented
new features.

The progress of the roadmap is tracked by `github milestones <https://github.com/cstatz/blazert/milestones/>`_.

`Open issues <https://github.com/cstatz/blazert/issues/>`_ can be considered as being discusses or worked on.

* Scientific/Engineering Helpers

    * distance to surface calculations
    * count intersections for given primitive range

* Python API: the high level API will be wrapped in Python in order to simplify the usage of the library.
